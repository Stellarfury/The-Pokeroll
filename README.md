# Your Game – Auth0 Login

A simple web game that uses Auth0 for sign‑up and sign‑in. The “Sign In” and “Sign Up” buttons are big for mobile, and the game UI shows a welcome message once a user is logged in.

## Setup
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` and replace `YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN` and `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your Auth0 application values.
3. Add your game logic to `app.js` (place it after the “YOUR GAME CODE HERE” comment).

## Auth0 Configuration
- **Allowed Callback URLs**: `https:                                                                           
- **Allowed Logout URLs**: same as above  
- **Allowed Web Origins**: same as above

                  
Open `index.html` in a browser; the Auth0 SDK will redirect to the Auth0 login page.

             
Push to your GitHub repository and enable GitHub Pages. The site will be live at `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR_REPO/`.

Feel free to tweak the styles in `index.html` or expand the game in `app.js`—have fun building!
